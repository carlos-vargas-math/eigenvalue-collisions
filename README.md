Main
1. initalize an eigenvalue summary with main_s_data.py
2. compute rotation process at a given s_step using main_t_data.py
3. run animation_and_summary/animation.py for visualization of the rotating process.

ToDo/Fix
1. Only works for curve = CIRCLE for now  
(there must be errors of continuity with parametrizations CIRCUIT and CROSSING)
2. Compute some more relevant data for summary/animation such as: smallest distances (summary), Delaunay triangulations (animation)
